# Learn Git by Building an SQL Reference Object

> Welcome to the git lessons!

## 10. Start Terminal

### 10.1

The first thing you need to do is start the terminal. Open a new one by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the window, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type `echo hello git` into the terminal and press enter.

#### HINTS

- Follow the directions closely
- If the tests don't pass, trash all the terminals with the trash can icon at the top right of the terminal. Then, redo those instructions

## 20. Make Directory

### 20.1

You should be in the `project` folder in the terminal you opened. Use the terminal to make a new directory named `sql_reference` in the `project` folder. As a reminder, you can use the `mkdir` command to make a new folder.

#### HINTS

- Enter `mkdir sql_reference` in the terminal from the `project` folder
- Enter `cd ~/project` to get to the `project` folder if you aren't there
- Don't try to create the folder with another method

## 30. Change Directory

### 30.1

Use the "change directory" command in the terminal to change to your new folder.

#### HINTS

- Enter `cd sql_reference` into the terminal
- Make sure you are in the `project` folder first
- Enter `cd ~/project` to get to the `project` folder if you aren't there

## 40. Initialize a git Repository

### 40.1

Git is a version control system to keep track of your code. This folder will be your git repository. Turn it into one by typing `git init` in the terminal from this folder.

#### HINTS

- Enter `git init` into the terminal while in the `sql_reference` folder
- Make sure you are in the `sql_reference` folder first
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to get to the folder if you aren't there

## 50. View .git Folder

### 50.1

Use the list command with the `-a` flag to list the hidden folders and files.

#### HINTS

- The list command is `ls`
- Type `ls -a` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in the `sql_reference` folder first
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 60. git status

### 60.1

The `git init` command created that `.git` folder for you. It's what keeps track of all the things in your repository. Use `git status` to see the status of where you are. This command will be your best friend.

#### HINTS

- Type `git status` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in the `sql_reference` folder first
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 70. Checkout main Branch

### 70.1

A git repository has branches to help keep track of things you are doing with your code. It's common to have a `main` branch which might be for your production code, and other branches for adding new features or fixing bugs. You can create and go to a new branch with `git checkout -b new_branch`. The `-b` stands for "branch". Use that command to switch to a new branch named `main`.

#### HINTS

- Capitalization matters
- Type `git checkout -b main` into the terminal
- Make sure you are in your `sql-reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 80. git status

### 80.1

Check your status again with `git status`.

#### HINTS

- Type `git status` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 90. touch README.md

### 90.1

Now you are on the `main` branch. Use the `touch` command to create `README.md` inside your repository. This is a file you will see in many repos to describe what the repo is for.

#### HINTS

- Use `touch file_name` to create a file
- Type `touch README.md` into the terminal and press enter
- Don't try to create the file with another method
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 100. Add Readme Text

### 100.1

Add the text `SQL Reference` at the top of your new file to let people know what your repo is for.

#### HINTS

- Add the suggested text in your `README.md` file

## 110. git status

### 110.1

Check the status of your repo again.

#### HINTS

- Use the "git status" command in your repo
- Type `git status` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 120. git add README.md

### 120.1

The file you created has not been added to git yet so it is showing that it is untracked. There's two steps to make git keep track of it for you. First you need to add it to the staging area like this: `git add file_name`. Add your `README.md` file to the staging area.

#### HINTS

- Replace `file_name` in the example with your `README.md` file
- Type `git add README.md` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 130. git status

### 130.1

Check your status again.

#### HINTS

- Use the "git status" command in your repo
- Type `git status` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 140. touch sql_reference.json

### 140.1

Now your file is in staging and will be added with the next commit. You aren't quite ready to commit this yet though. Use `touch` again to create `sql_reference.json` in your repo.

#### HINTS

- Use `touch file_name` to create a file
- Type `touch sql_reference.json` into the terminal and press enter
- Don't try to create the file with another method
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 150. git status

### 150.1

Check your status again.

#### HINTS

- Use the "git status" command in your repo
- Type `git status` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 160. git add Initial commit

### 160.1

You now have one file in staging and one that is untracked. Add the new file you created to the staging area.

#### HINTS

- Here's the example again: `git add file_name`
- You added the last one with `git add README.md`
- Type `git add sql_reference.json` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 170. git status

### 170.1

Check your status one more time please :grin:

#### HINTS

- Use the "git status" command in your repo
- Type `git status` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 180. git commit Initial commit

### 180.1

Now you have two files in staging. To commit them, you can use `git commit -m "Initial commit"`. The `-m` stands for "message". Often times, the first commit of a repo will have the message "Initial commit". Commit your two files with the message `Initial commit`.

#### HINTS

- Type `git commit -m "Initial commit"` in the terminal and press enter
- Enter `git log` to see if your message is correct
- If the message is wrong, enter `git reset HEAD~1`, then `git add .`, and then you can try to make the commit again
- Or, reset the lesson and try again

## 190. git status

### 190.1

When you make a commit, whatever is in the staging area will be added to your git history. You can see some info in the terminal output about the commit. Check your status again to see what's there.

#### HINTS

- Use the "git status" command in your repo
- Type `git status` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 200. git log

### 200.1

Your "working tree" is clean, the files were committed and there's no other new changes that git recognizes. You can see your commit history with `git log`. Check your commit history.

#### HINTS

- Type `git log` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 210. Add CREATE DATABASE Command

### 210.1

You can see the commit you made. It shows the message you gave with the commit, along with your username, email, the date, and a commit hash. The hash is that long string of characters. Open up your `.json` file and create an object with a reference for how to create a database that looks like this:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "create": "CREATE DATABASE database_name;"
  }
}
```

Make sure there's one empty line at the bottom of the file and no extra spaces after the value or any of the curly brackets.

#### HINTS

- Add the suggested object to your `sql_reference.json` file
- Double check for those extra spaces and the empty line

## 220. git status

### 220.1

Check your status again.

#### HINTS

- Use the "git status" command in your repo
- Type `git status` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 230. git diff

### 230.1

Git recognizes new unstaged changes to your file. Notice that it says that file is modified instead of untracked because the file has been previously committed. You can see the changes you made with `git diff`. Take a look at the new changes.

#### HINTS

- Type `git diff` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 240. git add sql_reference.json

### 240.1

The lines with `+` in front means that those lines were added. Add your new changes to staging with the `git add` command again. Make sure to put the filename you want to add at the end of the command.

#### HINTS

- You previously used `git add README.md` to add changes to staging
- Type `git add sql_reference.json` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 250. git status

- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 260. git commit feat: add create database reference

### 260.1

Your new changes are staged and ready to be committed. Commit them with the message `feat: add create database reference`. As a reminder, here what the command to commit looks like: `git commit -m "message"`.

#### HINTS

- Type `git commit -m "feat: add create database reference"` into the terminal and press enter
- View your `git log` to see if your message is correct
- If the message is wrong, enter `git reset HEAD~1`, then `git add .`, and then you can try to make the commit again
- Or, reset the lesson and try again
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 270. git log

### 270.1

Commit messages often start with `fix:` or `feat:`, among others, to help people understand what your commit was for. Check your `git log` again to see the new commit added.

#### HINTS

- Type `git log` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 280. Add DROP DATABASE command

### 280.1

Now there's two commits in your history, the newest one is at the top :smile: In your JSON file, add a `drop` key to your `database` object. Give it a value for how to drop a database similar to the `create` value. The syntax is in the hints. Again, make sure there's an empty line at the bottom of the file and no extra spaces after any values or curly brackets.

#### HINTS

- The value should be `"DROP DATABASE database_name;"`
- Don't forget the comma at the end of the previous line to make it a valid json object.
- Your database object should have these values:
```json
{
  "create": "CREATE DATABASE database_name;",
  "drop": "DROP DATABASE database_name;"
}
```
- The whole file should look like this:
```json
{
  "database": {
    "create": "CREATE DATABASE database_name;",
    "drop": "DROP DATABASE database_name;"
  }
}

```
- Make sure there's one empty line at the bottom of the file and no extra spaces after any of the values or curly brackets
- You can view the `git diff` to see if there's any extra spaces

## 390. Add CREATE TABLE Command

### 390.1

Like I said, you often don't want to make commits directly to the main branch of a repo. This branch will be for some new changes. What you will do is make the changes and commits here, then merge them into the `main` branch when they are ready. Add a reference for creating an SQL table to your json file along side your `database` property. Make it look like this:

```json
"table": {
  "create": "CREATE TABLE table_name;"
}
```

#### HINTS

- Make sure to add commas to keep it a valid json object
- The `table` key should be on the same level as the `database` key
- The whole file should look like this:
```json
{
  "database": {
    "create": "CREATE DATABASE database_name;",
    "drop": "DROP DATABASE database_name;"
  },
  "table": {

- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/sql_reference` to go to the folder if you aren't there

## 470. git merge feat/add-create-table-reference

### 470.1

You created the `feat/add-create-table-reference` branch, made a commit, and now it's ready to be added to the `main` branch. You can use `git merge branch_name` to bring changes from a branch into the branch you are currently on. Merge the changes from your feature branch into the `main` branch.

#### HINTS

- Type `git merge feat/add-create-table-reference` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you enter the command while on the `main` branch

## 480. git log oneline

#### HINTS

- The `column` key should be on the same level as the `table` key
- The `column` object should look like this:
```json
"column": {
  "add": "ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name;"
}
```
- The whole file should look like this:
```json
{
  "database": {
    "create": "CREATE DATABASE database_name;",
    "drop": "DROP DATABASE database_name;"
  },
  "table": {
    "create": "CREATE TABLE table_name;",

## 780. git rebase main

### 780.1

You created this branch and made a commit. Since then, a commit for a bug fix was added to `main`. This is common with many people working on a codebase simultaneously. You need to update this branch so it has the same commits from `main`, but you can't just merge that branch into this one. You need that bug fix commit to be in the same order here as it is on `main`, right after the "drop table" commit. You need to `rebase` this branch against `main` to do that. Enter `git rebase main` to rebase this branch.

#### HINTS

- Type `git rebase main` into the terminal and press enter

## 790. git log oneline

### 790.1

#### HINTS

- Use the `git log` command with the correct flag
- It's the `--oneline` flag
- Type `git log --oneline` into the terminal and press enter

## 800. Add DROP COLUMN command

### 800.1

The logs show that the bug fix commit from `main` was added, and then the commit from this branch was added on top of it. Now, when this branch is ready to be merged into `main`, it will have the same commit history. You should try to keep your branches up to date like this by rebasing them often. In your JSON file, add a `drop` key to the `column` object with a reference for dropping a column. The syntax is in the hints, give it a try first.

#### HINTS

- It follows a similar syntax as adding a column
- Don't forget the semi-colon at the end
- Here's the syntax: `ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;`
- Make sure the above value is in the `column.drop` key
- Here's what the `column` object should look like:
```json
"column": {
  "add": "ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name;",
  "drop": "ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;"
}
```
- The whole file should look like this:
```json
{
  "database": {
    "create": "CREATE DATABASE database_name;",
    "drop": "DROP DATABASE database_name;"
  },
  "table": {
    "create": "CREATE TABLE table_name();",
    "drop": "DROP TABLE table_name;"
  },
  "column": {
    "add": "ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name;",
    "drop": "ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;"
  }
}

```

#### HINTS

- Your JSON object should have this:
```json
"row": {
  "insert": "INSERT INTO table_name(columns) VALUES(values);"
}
```
- The `row` key should be on the same level as the `table` key
- The whole file should look like this:
```json
{
  "database": {
    "create": "CREATE DATABASE database_name;",
    "drop": "DROP DATABASE database_name;"
  },

## 940. git rebase main

### 940.1

Another commit was added to `main`, you should update this branch again. To be more specific, a rebase will "rewind" this branch to where it last matched `main`, then, add the commits from `main` that aren't here. After that, it adds the commits you made to this branch on top. `rebase` this branch against `main` so it's up to date. You should see a conflict...

#### HINTS

- Here's an example: `git rebase branch_name`
- Type `git rebase main` into the terminal and press enter

## 950. fix conflicts

### 950.1

The conflict arose because the first commit you added to this branch changed the same lines as the commit from `main`. So it tried to add the commit, but couldn't because something was already there. There are sections, separated by characters (`<`, `>`, and `=`), that represent the commit you are on (`HEAD`) and the commit that is trying to be added (`feat: add column reference`). Fix the conflict by removing those `<`, `>`, and `=` characters. Then making the JSON object valid again.

#### HINTS

- Be sure to remove all those special characters
- The part of the JSON object with conflicts should look like this:
```json
"row": {
  "insert": "INSERT INTO table_name(columns) VALUES(values);"
},
"column": {
  "add": "ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name;"
}
```
- The whole file should look like this:
```json
{
  "database": {
    "create": "CREATE DATABASE database_name;",

    "drop": "DROP TABLE table_name;"
  },
  "row": {
    "insert": "INSERT INTO table_name(columns) VALUES(values);"
  },
  "column": {
    "add": "ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name;"
  }
}

## 980. Add RENAME COLUMN command

### 980.1

You can see the "insert row" commit from `main` was added to this branch before the two commits you made here. Now this branch is up to date and you can continue working on it. Add a `rename` key to the `column` object. The value should look like this: `"ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name;"`

#### HINTS

- The `column` key should look like this:
```json
"column": {
  "add": "ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name;",

#### HINTS

- The `column` key should look like this:
```json
"column": {
  "add": "ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name;",

View the diff to make sure you like the changes, then add the changes to staging.

#### HINTS

- Use the `git add` command
- Here's an example: `git add file_name`
- You previously used `git add README.md` to add changes to staging
- Type `git add sql_reference.json` into the terminal and press enter

## 1530. git commit feat: add unique reference

### 1530.1

Commit the stages files with `feat: add unique reference` for the message.

#### HINTS

- Commit changes with `git commit -m "message"`
- Type `git commit -m "feat: add unique reference"` into the terminal and press enter
- View your `git log` to see if your message is correct
- If the message is wrong, enter `git reset HEAD~1`, then `git add .`, and then you can try to make the commit again
- Or, reset the lesson and try again

## 1533. git reset HEAD~1

### 1533.1

I'm going to show you a few ways to remove or undo a commit. The first is to simply "travel back in time". You can use the `git reset` command to travel to any point in your commit history. Your current `HEAD` is a reference to the last commit you just made. Use `git reset HEAD~1` to go back one before `HEAD`.

#### HINTS

- Enter `git reset HEAD~1` in the terminal

## 1536. git log oneline

### 1536.1

This is a "mixed" reset and will put the changes from the commit you undid in your working tree. You can see that it says there's unstaged changes after the reset to your file. View your log with the oneline flag.

#### HINTS

- Use the `git log` command with the correct flag
- It's the `--oneline` flag
- Type `git log --oneline` into the terminal and press enter

## 1539. git status

### 1539.1

Your commit for how to set a column to unique is gone. View your status.

#### HINTS

- Use the "git status" command in your repo
- Type `git status` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in your `sql_reference` repo folder

## 1540. git diff

### 1540.1

View the diff.

#### HINTS

- Use the "git diff" command
- Type `git diff` into the terminal and press enter

## 1542. git add UNIQUE command

### 1542.1

And the changes from the reset are back in the working tree. So when you `reset` to one commit before `HEAD`, it removed the most recent commit, and put all the changes in the working tree. If you used the `--hard` flag with the reset, the changes would have not been added to the working tree and if you used the `--soft` flag, the changes would have been added to the working tree and to staging. Add the changes back to staging so you can commit them again.

#### HINTS

- Use the `git add` command
- Here's an example: `git add file_name`
- You previously used `git add README.md` to add changes to staging
- Type `git add sql_reference.json` into the terminal and press enter

## 1545. git commit feat: add unique reference

### 1545.1

Commit the change staged files with `feat: add unique reference` for its message.

#### HINTS

- Commit changes with `git commit -m "message"`
- Type `git commit -m "feat: add unique reference"` into the terminal and press enter
- View your `git log` to see if your message is correct
- If the message is wrong, enter `git reset HEAD~1`, then `git add .`, and then you can try to make the commit again
- Or, reset the lesson and try again

## 1548. git revert HEAD

### 1548.1

Reverting is a good way to undo a commit because you don't lose the commit from the history. You can revert the most recent commit (`HEAD`) with `git revert HEAD`. Do that now.

#### HINTS

- Enter the suggested command
- Enter `git revert HEAD` in the terminal

## 1549. Nano: Enter git revert HEAD Message

### 1549.1

Git put you into Nano and is asking you enter a commit message for the revert, but they added a default one for you. Don't change anything in Nano, just exit the file to use the default message. You can exit the file by pressing `ctrl+x`.

#### HINTS

- Exit the file by pressing `ctrl+x`
- If you accidentally changed something in Nano, press `n` after `ctrl+x` to discard the changes
- Your last commit message should be `Revert "feat: add unique reference"`
- View your log to make sure the message is correct
- To reset this lesson, make sure nano is closed. Then, hit reset and enter `git revert HEAD` after it's done resetting

## 1551. git log oneline

### 1551.1

View the log with that flag I like again.

#### HINTS

- It's the `--oneline` flag
- Type `git log --oneline` into the terminal and press enter
- Press enter until you have seen the whole log

## 1554. git show

### 1554.1

#### HINTS

- Enter the suggested command
- Type `git show` in the terminal and press enter

## 1560. git rebase interactive HEAD~2

### 1560.1

If you look at the bottom of those two messages, it shows the diff. The diff of the revert commit is the exact opposite of the one before it. Effectively, undoing the changes. You've used rebase to update this branch, but you can enter an "interactive" mode to manipulate commits. Type `git rebase --interactive HEAD~2` into the terminal to enter this mode. The `HEAD~2` means you will have a chance to change the last two commits.

#### HINTS

- Enter the suggested command
- Type `git rebase --interactive HEAD~2` into the terminal and press enter
- If you entered the wrong command, save and exit Nano. Then try again
- You can save and exit Nano by pressing `ctrl+x` then `y` then `enter`

## 1563. Nano: Drop UNIQUE commits

### 1563.1

At the top of Nano, you can see the two commits with `pick` next to them. Below them, there's a list of options for working with them. `pick` means that it will use the commits as they were. At the bottom, it says, `d, drop = remove commit`. Replace the word `pick` preceeding your two commits with a `d` to drop them both. When you are done, save the file and exit Nano.

#### HINTS

- You can save and exit Nano by pressing `ctrl+x` then `y` then `enter`
- The most recent commit message should be `feat: add foreign key reference`
- To reset this lesson, make sure nano is closed. Then, hit reset and enter `git rebase --interactive HEAD~2` after it's done resetting

## 1564. git log oneline

### 1564.1

View your log. Use the `--oneline` flag.

#### HINTS

- Press enter until you have seen the whole history

## 1567. git rebase interactive root

### 1567.1

Both, the commit to add the unique command and the one to revert it, were dropped. Enter another `--interactive` rebase that goes back to the `--root` instead of `HEAD~2`. I am going to show you how to change a commit message. `--root` means that the rebase will go back to your very first commit.

#### HINTS

- The command is `git rebase` with two arguments
- The two arguments are `--interactive` and `--root`
- Enter `git rebase --interactive --root` into the terminal and press enter

## 1570. Nano: Select Reword Column References Commit

### 1570.1

You can see that the latest commit is at the bottom here. Be careful not to change the wrong commits. One of the options is `r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message`. Replace `pick` with an `r` next to the commit with the message `feat: add column reference` to reword the message, it's the very first commit you added to this branch. When you are done, save the file and exit Nano. Git will put you in another Nano instance to reword the commit message. Don't change anything in it yet.

#### HINTS

- Replace `pick` with an `r` next to the suggested commit
- Save and exit the file by pressing `ctrl+x` then `y` then `enter`
- To reset this lesson, make sure nano is closed. Then, hit reset and enter `git rebase --interactive --root` after it's done resetting

## 1572. Nano: Change Column References Commit Message

### 1572.1

Git is waiting for you to edit the commit message. Add an `s` at the end of the commit message so it is `feat: add column references`. When you are done, save the file and exit Nano.

#### HINTS

- Save and exit the file by pressing `ctrl+x` then `y` then `enter`
- To reset this lesson, make sure nano is closed. Then, hit reset and enter `git rebase --interactive --root` after it's done resetting. Then, in nano, replace `pick` with an `r` next to the `feat: add column reference` commit, and save and exit

## 1575. git log oneline

View your log. Use the `--oneline` flag.

#### HINTS

- Use the `git log` command with the correct flag
- It's the `--oneline` flag
- Type `git log --oneline` into the terminal and press enter
- Press enter until you have seen the whole history

## 1576. git rebase main

### 1576.1

The message was reworded, but there's a problem. Look at the commit hash for your `Initial commit` from the last two times you viewed the log, it's that string left of the log. They aren't the same anymore since you rebased back to the root. Same goes for the rest of the commits. When you rebase interactively it changes all those hashes, so git sees them as different commits. If you were to try and merge this into `main`, it wouldn't work because they don't share the same history anymore. For this reason, you don't want to do an interactive rebase where you go back passed commits unique to the branch you are on. Fortunately, you can fix this. Enter `git rebase main` to realign the history of the two branches.

#### HINTS

- Use the "git rebase" command
- Add the branch after the command that you want to rebase against
- Here's an example: `git rebase branch_name`
- Type `git rebase main` into the terminal and press enter

## 1578. git log oneline

### 1578.1

View your log again. Use the `--oneline` flag.

#### HINTS

- It's the `--oneline` flag
- Type `git log --oneline` into the terminal and press enter

## 1580. git rebase interactive HEAD~5

### 1580.1

Now the hashes are the same as they were before you rebased back to `--root`, which is what they are on `main`. Enter another interactive rebase. Go back to the first commit you added to this branch, it's `HEAD~5`.

#### HINTS

- It's the `git rebase` command with two arguments
- The two arguments are `--interactive` and `HEAD~5`
- Enter `git rebase --interactive HEAD~5` into the terminal and press enter
- If you entered the wrong command, exit nano without changing anything. Then try again.
- You can exit nano by pressing `ctrl+x`
- If you accidentally changed something in Nano, press `n` after `ctrl+x` to discard the changes

## 1590. Nano: Squash feat/add-column-references Commits

### 1590.1

Squashing commits means that you will take a bunch of commits and turn them into one. This is helpful to keep your commit history clean and something you want try to do. Replace `pick` with an `s` next to all your commits except the one with the message `feat: add column references`. When you are done, save and exit the file. You will find yourself in another instance of Nano. Don't change anything in it yet.

#### HINTS

- Replace `pick` with an `s` next to the suggested commits
- Save and exit the file by pressing `ctrl+x` then `y` then `enter`
- The most recent commit message should be `feat: add column references`

## 1595. Nano: Save and Exit to Squash

### 1595.1

Nano brought up a list of all the commit messages you used for the commits. Don't change anything in there, just exit the file to use those messages and finish squashing the commits.

#### HINTS

- Press `ctrl+x` to exit the file
- To reset this lesson, make sure nano is closed. Then, hit reset and enter `git rebase --interactive HEAD~5` after it's done resetting. Then, in nano, replace `pick` with an `s` next to all the commits except the `feat: add column reference` commit, and save and exit

## 1600. git log oneline
